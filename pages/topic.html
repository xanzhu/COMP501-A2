      <h1>Affects of Ransomware in the Health Industry</h1>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Ransomware is a type of malware designed to restrict access to files and demand a specific condition which could be requesting a payment from the user to regain access to the original files or otherwise posing the threat of deleting all files in order to hold the victim ransom. (Humayun,2021)</p>
      <p>How these attacks work is first targeting the victim's device. A common method is embedding malicious code into common file types such as pdf files. This is where code is being run in the background the moment the file is opened. To an untrained eye, the user is often unable to distinguish the difference between a legitimate email and one that has been specifically crafted and designed in order to get the user to click on that file which is referred to as a phishing email.</p>
      <p>With this code running in the background all system files will become encrypted and then reach a splash screen that often includes a set of instructions on how to regain access to the system such as demanding payment. To increase the risk factor to the user a timer is introduced posing the threat of deleting all files on the system.</p>

      <h2>Importace</h2>
      <p>
        The importance of ransomware can be reflected on the three main points in cybersecurity (vulnerability, availability and integrity).
        This is an ongoing development which will continue to affect people's lives. Through methods of demanding for payment for users to
        obtain a decryption key (Reeve, 2021). As technology is becoming more accessible newer technologies are being
        introduced into the health industry which shifts the focus from using reduntant technologies to using more modern systems such as 
        cloud computing to solve repetitive tasks. The risk posed here is providing updates to systems whether its completely replacing with modern 
        technology or patching common security flaws. As attacks are becoming more advanced by the year understanding these types of attacks could
        help to give the health industry a head start to preventing future attacks before they occur.
      </p>

      <h2>Justification</h2>
      <p>
        The reason why we chose this topic is that as
        technology evolves cyber crimes have become a big issue. We decided to
        narrow the topic to ransomware because we think it affects people's real
        lives the most among other types of cyber-attacks. Since the hackers
        cause disruptions to the victims' files and data. Then demanding
        payment. It could be a huge financial loss on a personal level and in
        enterprise settings. We decided to focus on the effects in the health
        industry specifically in Australia and New Zealand because in the health
        industry causing disruption to the workflow can cause serious harm as
        every minute counts and there can be no downtime.
      </p>
      <p>Since ransomware attacks originate from normal activities that people do daily, such as web browsing or receiving emails, it makes it harder for users to determine whether the link or attachment is safe.(Cotton, 2021) An example is the evolution of ransomware where javascript became popular due to its ease of use and direct connection to the internet related software, hackers used many methods to manipulate the user into starting ransomware attacks on their systems, this shows as the technology evolves ransomware attacks will evolve as well.</p>
      <p>Cyber attacks are happening more than ever because technology is becoming more advanced. We focused on the health industry in Australia and New Zealand because it is a critical industry which everyone has access to and where most sensitive data is stored. According to the ministry of health New Zealand, healthcare is one of the most targeted sectors when it comes to cyber-attacks due to the nature of this industry relying on stable outdated technology rather than the latest technology practices.</p>
