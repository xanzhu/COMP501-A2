          <h1>Ethics of Ransomware in the Health Industry</h1>
          <p>While researching this topic we looked into areas of cybercrime covering why hackers chose the Health Industry to attack rather than any other specific locations. It was found that most attacks had originated from the practice of targeting outdated systems and a lack of industry training for staff members against modern risks (Royer, 2022)</p>
          <p>The public health industry is a primary target due to many conditions such as the lack of updates and general training for staff members. In 2020 the focus shifted to staff members and the health industry where it is a priority to protect patients and the community against the risks of Covid-19. While this was an important milestone it allowed for a perfect opportunity to become targets for common cyber security threats such as phishing which then lead to ransomware. With the rise of these attacks over the past few years, there should have been increasing in training and systems to pick up on these types of attacks before they occur. </p>
          <h2>Why the Health Industry?</h2>
          <p>One of the main reasons the health industry is targeted is the lack of updates to critical systems. The process of this is complicated due to a limited timeframe to apply critical updates. It was found that the majority of hospitals are running outdated frameworks which have been vulnerable for years. The wake-up call came when a local hospital was attacked in Waikato. Ransomware attacks are very uncommon in New Zealand due to our small population but once a window is opened there will hole for hackers and researchers to break into. After this attack was publicised across the nation a string of other attacks had targeted many different industries spanning from the stock market to banks. All types of attacks from Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks to Ransomware based attacks which left systems down for a long period of time that patients had to be transferred to other hospitals in the area while a fix was worked on.</p>
          <h2>Outcome and Solutions</h2>
          <p>Days without access to internal systems due to ransomware. This had a great effect on patient care where scheduled surgeries had to be postponed, and regular visits were postponed due to an unknown variant of ransomware. The solution came almost a week later. This is a major wake-up call to District Health Boards across the nation. One of the most notable improvements being made is the introduction of Cloud-based services and a push to hire IT professionals to help increase their systems.</p>
          <p>According to the ACM Code of Ethics professionals should have moral ethics to design and implement robust systems and remain secure (ACM, n.d). A shift towards increasing the budget for spending had been announced by the Ministry of Health pushing for a boost in spending specifically to the health industry to get their systems updated (MOH, 2021). With the focus being on stable systems rather than updated systems there has to be an ethical standpoint where it should be up to the government to invest in more protections for such a critical industry. The budget announced by the Ministry of Health will provide a good boost however 75.7million dollars over the course of three years is quite a small value considering the nature of upcoming risks and knowing that most health care providers are using outdated software is concerning. As a solution, new systems could be designed that minimize the downtime allowing for the industry to get ahead of the new wave of advanced security threats.</p>
          <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
          <p>After learning more about ransomware and how it can impact such an industry I have come to the conclusion that from my perspective more training is needed for staff members who have access to areas involved with the internet such as dealing with emails. Internal training should be commenced to pick up on staff members who are likely to fall for common risks such as phishing through regular phishing tests and general training practices for handling data. Another area to improve I thought would be to introduce a better internal system designed to be secure and provide fast authentication for staff members using their devices without the need to always type out a password rather than relying on modern technology such as YubiKey. There are many ways to improve and reduce the risk of ransomware attacks on the health industry. The most ethical way we can do this is to train the biggest flaw which is people in the meantime while other systems are being developed. </p>
