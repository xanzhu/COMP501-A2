<h1>Opportunities</h1>
<p>
  Cybercrime is a big issue throughout the world.
  As hackers have tried many different types of cyber-attacks,
  this helped industries to find security holes in their systems 
  and provide ongoing response to their systems to counter ransomware 
  as the technology advances (Royer, 2022). Ransomware attacks also act 
  as a wakeup call for individuals and the government. 
  After many ransomware attacks happened in the health industry, 
  the government decided to increase budget for training in 
  cyber security field. (MOH 2021).

<p>

  The opportunities that we can get from these attacks is that it helps 
  developers discover security vulnerabilities or holes in their systems and 
  provides an ongoing response to counter future ransomware attacks.
  When developing a new software there are always going to be flaws within 
  the software which aren't always found. Hackers put the spotlight in this area 
  which helps improve security practices but also improves the experience when dealing with similar attacks.
  This is also a wakeup call for the individuals and government to 
  improve their practices as the health industry is such a critical region. 
  Various steps to be introduced which improve the security of their systems 
  by using unique or more complex passwords instead. The ministry of health has stated that 
  they will increase the budget for the cybersecurity field over 3 years to cover up to 75.7 million dollars.
