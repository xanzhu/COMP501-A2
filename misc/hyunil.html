          <h1>Ethics of Ransomware in the Health Industry</h1>
          <p>The topic our group chose is ransomware attacks on the health industry. We mainly focused on Australia and New Zealand, and we tried to get the most recent and relevant resources. Ransomware attacks start with a victim opening an unknown email or links. Therefore, it affects the three main keys in cybersecurity (vulnerability, integrity, and availability). As technology has evolved, cybercrime has become a big issue throughout the world. </p>
          <p>There are some opportunities we can get from the ransomware, for instance, it helped industries to find security holes in their systems and allow them to prevent similar future attacks. In addition, it also acts as a wakeup call for the government and individuals who may be affected. The New Zealand government decided to invest more budget for training in the information security field (MOH, 2021). Furthermore, many websites require the individual to create their password with increased complexity.</p>
          <h2>Preventative mesasures</h2>
          <p>There are many ways we can improve from ransomware attacks in the health industry. Firstly, the government can increase the budget on the cyber-security field and focus on securing the health industry more than other fields due to being a critical industry. Secondly, developers can work on making the encryption more secure. Lastly, individuals could always have a backup system not setting the same passwords through different types of websites.</p>
          <p>For the risks, as ransomware attacks occur from the people doing daily activities such as web browsing or receiving email, companies or users who have no methods to protect against such attacks are easily targeted (Reeve, 2021). According to the ministry of health, healthcare is one of the most targeted sectors due to the nature of this industry relying on stable technology (MOH, 2021). Which can lead to financial risks. Furthermore, the Australian government has stated that the money does not guarantee access to the data (Australian Government, 2021). The biggest risk that ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector are delaying the surgical operation by locking the data stored in hospitals. it breaks the ACM code of ethics and professional conduct. Based on the research, it breaks the code of “Respect privacy” and “Avoid harm”.</p>
          <h2>Can ransomware be ethical?</h2>
          <p>When it comes to “is ransomware attacks on the health industry ethical”, the answer is probably “not”.</p>
          <p>One of the general ACM ethical codes, “Respect privacy” is important because technology enables the collection and monitoring of personal information quickly. Otherwise, it might lead to an increased risk of breaking another ethical standard. Which is “Avoid harm”. This is crucial because the ransomware attack not only influences people mentally but also physically by demanding money which causes extra stress further leading someone to harm themselves. Due to financial reasons.</p>
          <h2>Self Reflection</h2>
          <p>After researching resources on ransomware attacks in the health industry, I have found that ransomware has a serious impact. Especially in aged care where the general need for more surgical operations and access to healthcare facilities are required. I have found that ransomware also helps developers to find vulnerabilities in systems and helped them to prevent similar attacks in the future. To prevent further risks and negative consequences, the government and individuals should focus on acknowledging that cyber-attacks will evolve, and it will affect people’s lives more as more things will be replaced by technology and stable systems become obsolete as each generation pass.</p>
