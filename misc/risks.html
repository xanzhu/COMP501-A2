<h1>Risks</h1>

<h2>Vulnerability</h2>
<p>
  As ransomware attacks can occur from the simple act of opening an email attachment or link, 
  It can have a great impact on companies or users who have no protection or methods 
  to protect against such attacks. (Reeve, 2021). This vulnerability causes problems 
  when dealing with a critical industry such as healthcare where without access to 
  specific files or systems, downtime can cause someone their life as every second matters. 
  This is a high-risk factor as there is very little downtime to patch or find a resolution 
  to these types of attacks.
</p>

<h2>Financial risks</h2>
<p>
  According to a research, in 2021, 55% of New Zealand businesses had been a subject 
  to a ransomware attack. Recent ransomware attack in Australia was targeting the aged care. 
  It was crucial because aged people tend to need more surgical operations and 
  they have more medical issues than the younger ones (Australian Government, 2021).
  The article also states that paying the money does not guarantee the access to the data. 
  It was predicted that the financial damage cost ranged from 50 billion dollars
  in 2017 to 200 billion dollars in less than 6 years.
