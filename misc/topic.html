      <h1>Ransomware in the health industry</h1>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        A cyber-attack which usually starts with a victim opening an unknown
        email that contains a malicious link or attachment where a code is
        designed to disrupt the victim's computer is being run in the background
        is Ransomware. The ransomware encrypts the victim's data/system files
        locking them out and demands payment to unlock (decrypt) to gain access
        to their data within a set time frame or face the risk of files being
        deleted thus holding the user ransom (Humayun,2021).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ransomware is a type of malware designed to
        restrict access to files and demand a specific condition to regain
        access to the original files then posing the threat of deleting all
        files in order to hold the victim ransom. This type of malware works by
        first infecting the user's computer. One method is embedding malicious
        code into common file types such as pdf, which you would normally see in
        email attachments. When opening the file it will open as normal however
        there is code being run in the background to encrypt all files. This
        then leads to a splash screen with demands for payment to decrypt and
        regain access to files within a time frame.
      </p>

      <h2>Importace</h2>
      <p>
        It is important in a way that it affects the three main keys in
        cybersecurity.i.e. (vulnerability, availability & integrity) which is an
        ongoing development affecting people's lives by demanding the payment
        for decryption keys (Reeve, 2021). With improving technology, software
        is becoming more accessible to the health industry which could pose a
        risk for the advanced types of attacks in future. Understanding these
        types of attacks early on, can give a head start towards preventing
        them.
      </p>

      <h2>Justification</h2>

      <p>
        We chose this topic because the ransomware attacks are happening now
        more than ever Since attacks originate from normal activities that
        people do, such as opening emails or clicking links on websites, it
        makes it harder for users to determine whether the link or attachment is
        safe or not (Cotton, 2021). Since the health industry is a critical
        industry where everyone has their details stored, it is important to
        explore further about how it affects people's lives. Our group decided
        to focus on (Oceania region) mainly New Zealand and Australia focusing
        on the implications which come with ransomware.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason why we chose this topic is that as
        technology evolves cyber crimes have become a big issue. We decided to
        narrow the topic to ransomware because we think it affects people's real
        lives the most among other types of cyber-attacks. Since the hackers
        cause disruptions to the victims' files and data. Then demanding
        payment. It could be a huge financial loss on a personal level and in
        enterprise settings. We decided to focus on the effects in the health
        industry specifically in Australia and New Zealand because in the health
        industry causing disruption to the workflow can cause serious harm as
        every minute counts and there can be no downtime.
