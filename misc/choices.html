<h2>What is the future of ransomware technology? </h2>
<p> 
  One of the first ransomware attacks was introduced in 1989 by Harvard biologist Joseph Popp.
  Known as the AIDS Trojan which was distributed through a floppy disk at a 
  World health organisation conference about AIDS to 20,000 researchers. 
  Comparing to modern technologies where ransomware appears more commonly in the wild, 
  An increase in encryption is the main factor of where this technology will lead. 
  From the span of 2006 to 2016 more tools and software have been developed to evade detection methods(Dimkin, 2021).
  As each year passes there will be an increase in encryption and new ways to exploit and invade systems. 
</p>

<h2>How can we reduce the risk of Ransomware in future? </h2>
<p>
  Governments can increase the budget for providing training for companies on how they manage their data
  ensuring they have backup systems in place such as providing different backup types: physical, cloud and offsite. 
  Training staff members against the risk of phishing attacks which is the most common way ransomware 
  and common cybersecurity attacks occur by clicking unknown links/attachments or sharing sensitive data 
  to unknown entities (Humayun, 2021). Create new systems which can work with minimal downtime. 
  Allowing for flaws to be patched in real time without downtime keeping systems running while 
  being up to date and secure with the latest technology.
</p>

<p>
  The future of ransomware can be seen by first looking back on the first ransomware attack which 
  was introduced in 1989 by a Harvard biologist Joseph Popp researching AIDS. 
  This ransomware was known as the AIDs Trojan which was distributed 
  using a floppy disk to over 20,000 researchers spanning more than 90 countries.
  Comparing this to modern ransomware attacks, the method of distribution has changed 
  where these types of attacks are more commonly found in the wild making it harder 
  to isolate who created it or where it originated from. The advancement of encryption has 
  increased in complexity as technology has become more accessible than it was in 1989. 
  As each year passes there will be an increase in new technology and practices, 
  bringing new ways to exploit and invade systems. 
</p>

<p>
  To prevent ransomware attacks in future we'd need to do a lot of things, 
  one of those being increasing the government spending towards training and 
  development for critical industries on new technologies and introducing better security practices. 
  For example training staff members against the risk of phishing attacks which is the 
  number one cause of ransomware and other common cyber security attacks. 
  Another method could be to design better systems for handling software or 
  hardware updates that prioritize minimal downtime.
